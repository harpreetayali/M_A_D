   - **Foldable Phones:** Samsung, Huawei, and others introduced foldable smartphones, a new form factor that combines a smartphone and tablet experience.

6. **Future Trends - Beyond 5G:**
   - **6G and Beyond:** Anticipated to provide even faster speeds and seamless connectivity, enabling advanced applications we can only imagine.
   - **AI Integration:** AI will play a central role in optimizing user experiences, personalizing interactions, and enhancing device capabilities.
   - **Extended Reality (XR):** A fusion of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) will redefine how we perceive and interact with the digital world.

### Describe the basic stages in the lifecycle of an Android activity and when each stage occurs.
The lifecycle of an Android activity consists of several stages through which the activity transitions as it is created, started, resumed, paused, stopped, and ultimately destroyed. Below is a description of the basic stages in the lifecycle of an Android activity along with a diagram illustrating the transitions between these stages:

1. **Created (onCreate):**
   - This is the initial stage when the activity is first created.
   - Typically, initialization and setup tasks are performed in this stage.
   - `onCreate()` method is called during this stage.

2. **Started (onStart):**
   - The activity becomes visible to the user, though not in the foreground.
   - Commonly used to register broadcast receivers or other components.
   - `onStart()` method is called during this stage.

3. **Resumed (onResume):**
   - The activity is in the foreground and can interact with the user.
   - This is where the app begins to actively interact with the user.
   - `onResume()` method is called during this stage.

4. **Paused (onPause):**
   - The activity is partially visible, and another activity is in the foreground but not covering the entire screen.
   - Use this stage to pause or adjust ongoing processes that don't impact the user experience.
   - `onPause()` method is called during this stage.

5. **Stopped (onStop):**
   - The activity is no longer visible to the user.
   - This stage occurs when the activity is being covered by another activity or when it's being destroyed.
   - `onStop()` method is called during this stage.

6. **Destroyed (onDestroy):**
   - The activity is being destroyed either due to the user navigating away, the system needing resources, or calling `finish()` method.
   - Commonly used for releasing resources, unregistering listeners, etc.
   - `onDestroy()` method is called during this stage.

Here's a diagram illustrating the transitions between these stages:

```
     |    Created (onCreate)
     V
   Started (onStart)
     V
   Resumed (onResume)
     V
   Paused (onPause)
     V
   Stopped (onStop)
     V
  Destroyed (onDestroy)
```

This diagram represents the sequence of transitions an Android activity goes through during its lifecycle. 

The activity typically starts at "Created," progresses through the stages based on user and system interactions, and eventually reaches "Destroyed" when it's no longer needed. 

###  List the components of the mobile ecosystem and discuss.

The mobile ecosystem is a vast and interconnected environment comprising various components that work together to enable mobile communication, applications, and services. Here are the key components of the mobile ecosystem and a brief discussion of each:
